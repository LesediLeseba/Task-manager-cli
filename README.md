# Task Tracker CLI

A simple Command Line Interface (CLI) application built with Python to manage and track tasks.  
This tool allows you to add, update, delete, and track the status of tasks directly from your terminal.

The application stores tasks in a JSON file in the current directory and uses only Python’s standard library.
